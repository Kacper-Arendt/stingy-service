### Team Membership Query Service Usage Examples
### This service is designed for internal use by other modules (like Retro)
### Only contains GetMembershipAsync method

@baseUrl = https://localhost:7001
@teamId = {{$guid}}
@userId = {{$guid}}

### Get user membership details (if exposed through API)
# GET {{baseUrl}}/api/teams/{{teamId}}/membership/{{userId}}

### if (membership == null) { /* User is not a member */ }
### if (membership.Role == TeamParticipantRole.Owner) { /* User is owner */ }
### if (membership.Role == TeamParticipantRole.Admin) { /* User is admin */ }
### if (membership.Status == TeamParticipantStatus.Active) { /* User is active */ }
